# Scheduling_Procedures

If you want to test my code:

- create a new c++ project in any working environment
- clone my main.cpp file
- run 

Below you see some little description:

Here I have written a programme in which you first select one of two multi-dimensional arrays. These two arrays are each occupied with 5 different processes. For each process there is a deadline in which the process must be completed, a ready time that indicates how long the process needs until it is ready and a service time how long the process needs for its task.  You can then choose one of 6 scheduling methods to run the selected processes. Each step is displayed.  Finally, you can see the total amount of time taken for all processes and the average waiting time.
The output text is in german!
