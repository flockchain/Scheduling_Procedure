# Scheduling_Procedures
Here I have written a programme in which you first select one of two multi-dimensional arrays. These two arrays are each occupied with 5 different processes. For each process there is a deadline in which the process must be completed, a ready time that indicates how long the process needs until it is ready and a service time how long the process needs for its task.  You can then choose one of 6 scheduling methods to run the selected processes. Each step is displayed.  Finally, you can see the total amount of time taken for all processes and the average waiting time.
